# Advanced Geospatial - Lab 6: Line Simplification

This assignment focuses on simplifying polylines using Turf.js, and visualizing everything interactively on a Leaflet map.

## 🧭 What It Does

- Lets users draw a polyline on a map centered over Calgary
- Simplifies the drawn line using Turf.js
- Displays both the original and simplified versions in GeoJSON format
- Includes a button to clear the map and start fresh

## 🛠 Tools I Used

- **Leaflet.js** — for creating the interactive map
- **Leaflet.draw** — to allow drawing directly on the map
- **Turf.js** — for simplifying the geometry (removing extra points while keeping the shape)

## 💡 Why I Chose Leaflet

The assignment gave us the freedom to pick any mapping library. I chose Leaflet because:
- It's lightweight and easy to work with
- It pairs really well with Turf.js
- The documentation is straightforward and beginner-friendly
